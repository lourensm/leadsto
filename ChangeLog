Known unsolved bugs/problems: 

- Printout multi page windows of lt/checker trees is broken.	
- Interrupting running checker:
	Make the background window visible,
	type Control-C and then after response: 
		Action (h for help) ?
	type: a   (or Control D)

	- -tracerangepixels with no numeric argument doesnt complain
	  but does...?
	- Possibly advanced multiple page ps to printer gives problems.
	- advanced winprinting does not function (at least at cs.vu.nl)
	- Should probably warn against using holds PROPERTIES
	===================================================================
	TODO: arc from node to oneself.
	- started implementing sort extensions:
	  * sorts may contain subsorts, 
	  * sorts may contain variables in their name
	  * sorts may contain terms containing variables (isolated or not)
	  Really incomplete:
	  * only handles between(X,Y) sorts
	  * only handles sort definitions defining less than 100
	    instantiated sorts
	  * only handles sorts containing less than 100 instantiated elements.
	  TODO: need to retain the original sort definition or an annotated 
	   version: transnew and other termrewriters should be able to
	   refer to inside structure of sorts.

	- disply(_,_) entries work again.
version 1.28 Aug 17 2012
	- New SWI-Prolog version adaptations
	- bug efgh(0,1,1,1) seems to be solved.
version 1.27 Mon Nov 7 CET 2005

version 1.25 Thu Sep 29 13:46:51 CEST 2005
	- leadsto has standard -pxor enabled. lteditor NOT!
	- The warning BAD random number is replaced by some possibly more 
	  informative text, and only gets shown once.
	- PROSSIBLY? changed default behavior of no efgh implying default
	  0,0,1,1. There are predefined delay values:
	  standard = efgh(0,0,1,1) ; unit = efgh(1,1,1,1)
	- Changed code to accompodate SWI-pl version changes.
	- Warning discontiguous qterm/1 removed.

	- implemented |= as replacement of holds, also transformation thru edit
	- bug: checklist -> uchecklist 
version 1.23 Tue Mar  8 15:53:18 WEST 2005
	- Replaced default delay: was unit:efgh(1,1,1,1) now 
	  standard:efgh(0,0,1,1)
version 1.22 Tue Jan 18 16:35:09 WEST 2005
	- added epp_distance function
	- solved some pareto_distance crash
version 1.21 Mon Jan  3 13:18:25 WEST  2005
	- Some work on abmp installation
	- Solved leadsto bug: CWA -> garbage collection
version 1.20 Dec 17
	- abmp internal changes
	- recently introduced bug solved: wmf advanced printout
version 1.17 Dec 16
	- abmp: savedata, analyseabmp etc
version 1.16 Tue Nov 23 14:59:46 WEST 2004
	- FV lots of changes, something functioning.
version 1.15 Fri Nov 19 14:18:03 WEST 2004
	- FV project, still not visible, but internal changes.
	- Simulation Tool:
	  Some extra options in settings; look there. Width of true lines,
	  width of false lines, pixels per diagram.
	- TTLChecker: options -batch_all, -batch_true, -batch_false
	  see minimal explanation with ttlchecker --help
version 1.14 Mon Nov  1 14:46:56 WEST 2004
	- New utility: log2trace: DESIRE trace 
	  (generated by tgm => debugging => L) to trace.tr
version 1.13 Wed Oct 27 15:56:33 WEDT 2004
	- Complex expressions in leadsto specification made leadsto crash.
	  (lijn5-anorexia.lt)
version 1.12 Mon Oct 25 17:23:03 WEDT 2004
	- Recently introduced bug solved, a.o. cwa functions again.
version 1.11 Tue Oct  5 16:38:33 WEDT 2004
	- Mix of real numbers, integers remains problematical:
	  solved one more bug
version 1.10 Mon Oct  4 14:58:46 WEDT 2004
	- If ttlchecker expects integers (for instance in "between" sort but
	  trace provides some other value, checking crashes. This hasn't
	  been 100% solved, but more cases have been.
version 1.9 Thu Sep 30 18:59:25 WEDT 2004
	- If ttlchecker expects integers (for instance in "between" sort but
	  trace provides some other value, checking crashes. This hasn't
	  been 100% solved, but some cases have.
	- removing a trace made ttlchecker crash
version 1.8 Thu Sep 30 13:30:55 WEDT 2004
	- display(_,_) bug: could not use uppercase entries. Solved that
	  more or less: It could be that you need to reload and store
	  incorrect specifications.
	  NEW: you need to put quotes around uppercase names in
	     cwa(..) and display*
	- loading a second spec seems to not have been working, solved now.
version 1.7 Tue Sep 21 19:13:27 CEST 2004
	- object names may contain spaces, but any term containing subatoms
	  having spaces is interpreted as a single atom: any text that is not
	  a prolog term, is interpreted as an atom. This is not a good
	  systematic solution, will not work in formulae for example!
	- added abmp traces to installation.
version 1.6 Thu Sep 16 13:46:53 WEDT 2004
	- Better error message in case of corrupted configuration files.
	- Lots of internal reorganisation of sources.
version 1.5 Tue Aug 31 20:57:11 WEDT 2004
	- cwa is still not super stable: removed a bug. Preferably only
	  use cwa negative literals in rules that are completely instantiated.
version 1.4 Thu Aug 26 18:42:05 WEDT 2004
	- Rule with negative conclusion on cwa atom sometimes crashed.
	  Replaced by warning: useless?
version 1.3 Thu Aug 26 14:41:48 WEDT 2004
	- Some minor issue w.r.t. real numbers in intervals solved.
version 1.2 Thu Aug 19 10:17:36 WEDT 2004
	- Bug introduced in previous version corrected, almost nothing worked
	  (leadsto)
version 1.1 Wed Aug 18 13:23:42 WEDT 2004
	- Recognizing constants in start_time, end_time entries
	  (so define constant end_time = 1000 and use end_time(end_time))
version 1.0 Tue Aug 17 13:23:31 WEDT 2004
	(No mayor change but after 137 minor subversions its time to take
	 the software serious).
	- Minor improvement in error messaging
	- Lots of internal changes (forcevision project)
	- Some incomplete code for subsorts and sort terms.
version 0.137 Tue Jul 20 14:47:37 WEDT 2004
	- lteditor printout : constants did not print correctly
	- probably everywhere: finally removed annoying printout of ''
	  on uppercase subterms.
version 0.136 Tue Jul  6 16:37:44 WEDT 2004
	- made documentation of multiple traces a bit more user-friendly.
	- added multiple trace examples to installation. 
version 0.135 Fri Jul  2 17:08:33 WEDT 2004
	- comment almost production quality
version 0.134 Fri Jul  2 13:55:55 WEDT 2004
	- No longer recognise pi and e as arithmetic expressions.
	- Fixed just now introduced bug: TRACES always empty.
	- Incomplete code for comment.
version 0.133 Tue Jun 29 12:00:56 WEDT 2004
	- Fixed some broken cwa bug: cwa false atoms were ignored if
	  they occurred containing uninstantiated variables in rules.
	- Fixed some superfluous implementation errors after normal error 
	  messages.
	- First version of multiple models in one leadsto specification.
	  (see usermanual.html)
version 0.132 Tue Jun 22 16:41:23 WEDT 2004
	- leadsto rules containing negative cwa literals containing variables
	  lead to incorrect results: sometimes rules incorrectly did not fire,
	  sometimes an error message was given.
	  Have (partly) solved this problem.
version 0.131 Sun May 16 22:04:02 WEDT 2004
	- commdemo1 would not work on windows
	- bug: After first communication and link becoming inactive 
	  and active again, link would not be drawn. Lots of more bugs in
	  link displaying
version 0.130 Fri May 14 15:34:01 WEDT 2004
	- bug: sometimes with multiple back and forth comm, step failed.
version 0.129 Fri May 14 11:14:48 CEST 2004
	- Added settings to leadsto, but configurable properties for now 
	  mostly only relate to the communication graph feature.
	- Documented the properties in the usermanual.
	- added leadsto running suggestions to user manual.
	- Nodes change size with Communication strength.
version 0.128 Tue May 11 19:28:09 CEST 2004
	- Previous versions kept a maximum of 1 recent communication,
	  now each communication strengthens a link by adding 1, and
	  the strength decays exponential in time. 
version 0.127 Mon May 10 15:19:02 WEDT 2004
	- Added single stepping mode to communication visualisation.
	- Old outdated links get restored
version 0.126 Fri May  7 15:09:37 WEDT 2004
	- Added Communication Visualisation, see <code>usermanual.html</code>
	  somewhere in the installation directory for how to get started.
	- Leadsto: more places where atoms are no longer presorted
	  alphabetically -> saving of trace notably
version 0.125 Thu Apr 22 13:58:14 WEDT 2004
	- Leadsto:Behavior of printout of traces changed:
	   atoms used to be presorted alphabetically, no longer.
	- Introduced option:
	   display(View, sort_atoms_time_abc_global): then 
	    subsorting alphabetically is done.
version 0.124 Wed Apr 21 14:05:20 WEDT 2004
	- unloading specs that contained end_time crash.
version 0.123 Tue Apr 20 18:50:44 WEDT 2004
	- first bug after 0.122: load next spec in leadsto crashed
version 0.122 Tue Apr 20 14:50:44 WEDT 2004

	- Advanced printing for trees implemented.
version 0.120 Wed Mar 31 11:28:45 CEST 2004

	- for the time being all results of closures will be printed out
version 0.116 Fri Mar 19 10:12:19 WEST 2004
	- (new constructs sum,closure still very buggy:)solved 1st bug
version 0.115 Thu Mar 18 14:35:44 WEST 2004
	- Multi page printout improvements...
	- improved itef, case, sum, closure.
version 0.114 Mon Mar  8 17:59:49 CET 2004
	- added conditional variables (itef construct) analoguous to
	  V:SORT = case TTLCondition:expr1
	           otherwise expr2;

	- pxor (probabilistic consequent alternatives) testable:
	  - save/load
	  - lteditor
	  Enable with option pxor

	  setting: allows you to specify the maximum number of menu
	  items that are presented vertically.
	- added ChangeLog and issues.html and usermanual shortcuts to
	  windows installation.
version 0.110 Fri Jan 23 15:17:44 CET 2004
	- Bad bug in ttlchecker: interval range had extra value outside
	  of trace range having all holds values unknown. 
	  (last_interval interval was out of range of the whole trace
	   and sort interval was (and still is) defined as 
	   between(0, last_interval).
	  Corrected last_interval value.
version 0.109 Mon Jan 19 15:02:14 CET 2004
	- Improved pareto curve functionality.
version 0.108 Fri Jan 16 12:04:41 CET 2004
	- fixed in display traces: option display(View, sort_atoms_time_global)
	   - Previously atoms sorted on start of last non default range,
	     should have been first one.
	   - Sorting went wrong for mix of integer and real values.
version 0.107 Thu Jan 15 15:52:57 CET 2004
	- added -traces 'filespecwithwildcard * ? ' option
	- fixed some bugs in nash_distance evaluation
version 0.106 Wed Jan 14 13:13:18 WEST 2004
	- implemented nash_distance, see abmp.fm example
version 0.105 Thu Jan  8 11:58:43 CET 2004
	- pareto_distance debugged
	- added pareto:get_curve[(trace1)].
	   to printout negotiation
version 0.104 Fri Dec 19 10:22:16 CET 2003
	- added /hacked in pareto_distance function
version 0.103
	- Allow conditions in leadsto editor.
version 0.102
	- Previous version contained disabled experimental probabilistic
	  features. Part got enabled-> led to bugs. Solved.
	- (forgot to write down):ttlchecker : check verbose sometimes
	  crashed.
version 0.101
	- leadsto: postscript printing via File printing menu only printed
	  out postscript of buttons: fix in 0.100 was incorrect.
version 0.100
	- leadsto/ttlchecker: changed icon linux/unix
	- leadsto: enabled fix for e < f with no global_lambda
	- leadsto: bug could not make room for second trace/lt specification if
	  last trace contained cwa entry
	- leadsto: postscript printing via File printing menu only printed
	  out postscript of buttons.
	- leadsto: Changed some error messages (preparing for editor + rt)
	- leadsto: Internal change: preparations for probabilistic exclusive or
version 0.99 Mon Sep 29 20:45:07 CEST 2003
	- ttlchecker: Traces that contained mixed real and integer time values
	  (at least) sometimes lead to crashes. It could even be that
	  wrong results could have been produced without a crash(less 
	  probable).
version 0.98 Wed Sep 24 17:51:36 WEDT 2003
	- ttlchecker: Disjunction occurring in normalised form produced
	  wrong results if one branch simplified to true.
version 0.97 Fri Sep 19 22:52:28 WEDT 2003
	- ttlchecker: Using undefined sort used to exit the ttlchecker.
version 0.96
	- ttlchecker: better behavior for holds editor and constant editor.
	  (still not perfect)
	- Removed code and option for -newroundoff: was incorrect.
	  (Roundoff of real values only takes place at setting atoms;
	   so we do not add a new atom if there is an atom present (and of
	   which a trace value is present that may influence the rules) that
	   has a value idintical apart from rounding off)
version 0.95
	- ttlchecker:removed a debugging breakpoint
	- leadsto:e < f still produces incorrect traces, 
	  using option -checkhandled will give improved result for e < f, 
	  is being tested so not enabled by default.
version 0.94
	- The bugfix for e < f was incorrect for some specifications
	  and in spite of 0.93 entry enabled by default. Unintententionally
	  installed version 0.93 prematurely, version 0.94 is a correction:
	  This version:
	  e < f still produce incorrect traces, if really needed,
	  use option -checkhandled, which will sometimes give incorrect
	  results (BEING FIXED)
version 0.93
	- Fixed bug : variable editor did not update var:sort correctly
	  when using apply, ok button
	- Leadsto contains partly incorrect bugfix code, not 
	  activated. If you really need e < f, you could try
	  starting up leadsto with option -checkhandled,
	  but this will crash for specifications doing arithmetics.
	- leadsto: added "Reload" buttons.
	- leadsto: improved reporting activity in main window.
version 0.92
	- Fixed bug : leadsto accepted f < e, but probably sometimes
	  did not derive results correctly. Is now an error and rule
	  is discarded.
version 0.91 Tue Sep  2 18:36:47 CEST 2003
        - Fixed awkward bug: Rule not firing sometimes if:
	  * multiple antecedents
	  * e > 0
	  * some subtle constraints between e,f,g,h
	  (Fix may lead to other temporary instabilities.)
version 0.90 Tue Sep  2 15:13:19 CEST 2003
	- Minor correction in var_editor error detection
version 0.89 Tue Sep  2 14:37:27 CEST 2003
	- Changed variable editor: now the editor tries to accept as
	  much of the correct user input as possible
	- Some part editors:More error messages give feedback to both the
	  local editor and the background editor window.
	- var_editor: more consistent error checking.
version 0.88 Wed Aug 27 18:39:23 CEST 2003
	- Only now really solved partial crash in trying to change settings
version 0.87 Tue Aug 26 16:57:59 CEST 2003
	- (Changed -help option message: -cholds -nocholds options
	  do not influence any thing any longer)
	- Solved bug: windows version Settings selectione led to partial crash.
version 0.86 Tue Aug 26 14:38:59 CEST 2003
	- Trying to have a stable snapshot for prakticum. Some internal changes
	  since previous version.
version 0.85 Mon Jul  7 13:17:59 CEST 2003
	- Some internal changes, version is untested.
version 0.84 Thu Jul  3 11:25:26 CEST 2003
	- BUG SOLVED in ttlchecker(ttleditor): changing true sub formula to 
	  false (or other way around) and some other simple changes were not
	  propagated correctly (=> doing check after only such changes, 
	  checked the old formula)
	- Not activated code for external definitions (background knowledge)
version 0.83 Mon Jun 30 11:40:51 CEST 2003
	- solved bug: disjunction case now works exists(x,or(f1(x), f2))
version 0.82 Fri Jun 27 17:41:31 CEST 2003
	- Solved bug: variable hiding didn't function
	- Changed internals somewhat drastically: there was a bug
	  leading to impl_errors in case of multiple quantors with
	  some "effective negation" between quantors.
	- lteditor cwa(_) at reload became cwa('_') SOLVED
version 0.81 Thu Jun 26 10:18:30 CEST 2003
	- Horrible bug: multiple traces (often?) did not deal correctly
	  with different traces containing different time ranges.
	  (Not that bad as it would have given an error:
	    'Missing time from coded times:').
version 0.80 Wed Jun 18 23:19:16 CEST 2003
	- ttlchecker implemented last_interval (see usermanual.html)
version 0.79 Fri Jun 13 12:53:12 CEST 2003
	- ttlchecker: allow isolated variables in quantifiers
	- ttlchecker: bug solved -1 < i:integer <= 2 crashed
version 0.78 Wed Jun 11 15:27:03 CEST 2003
	- ttlchecker:Implemented disjunction where both branches
	  bind (common) variables.
version 0.77 Tue May 27 11:23:01 CEST 2003
	- Solved bug in cwa: Did not function at all up to now.
	  Is probably still shaky.
version 0.76 Thu May 22 15:40:37 CEST 2003
	- Allow multiple conditions -1 < X:real < 2.0 in ttlchecker
	- Solved bug for infinite range lhs of leadsto rules.
	- Somewhat big change to handling quantifiers =>
	  Solved bug "FP2_all_traces crashes"
	- Minimal improvement on messages to window in leadsto exe.
version 0.75 Wed May 21 15:31:12 CEST 2003
	- lteditor: allow display_number_range and display entries in lteditor
	- ltbare/leadsto:
	  Added options -tracerangepixels PIXELNUMBER,
	                -tracepicturepixels PIXELNUMBER
version 0.74 Mon May 19 15:14:40 CEST 2003
	- ttlchecker: allow \= in formulae comparing non arithmetic terms.
	- warnings got out of hand, solved
version 0.73 Sat May 10 14:53:29 CEST 2003
	- leadsto editor: 
	  -  periodical rules were not read in correctly
	  -  unrecognised terms(display/2) containing variables lead to
	     crash.
	- -gui color(node, Colour) option works, although why not use
	  settings?
	- Previous version crashed when quantifier variable was constrained.
	- \= operator also crashed for non numeric arguments.
version 0.72 Fri May  9 11:22:13 CEST 2003
	- leadsto: May now load and run different simulations after each other.
version 0.71 Thu May  1 12:25:27 CEST 2003
	- solved multiple -trace File -trace File cmdline arguments
	  now loads multiple (identical) traces.
	- small extra optimization if there is exactly one holds candidate
	  (gives warning: otherwise prolog formula not clear)
	- Reuse of quantifier variable names was buggy: corrected.
version 0.70 Thu Apr 24 15:36:13 CEST 2003
	- solved: occurring when checking formula containing 
	   var:integer + number in holds
version 0.69 Thu Apr 24 10:10:02 CEST 2003
	- small bug: substitute_properties crashed, solved
version 0.68 Wed Apr 23 09:27:28 CEST 2003
	- extra feature: substitute_properties:
	   menu of property node: adds a new node after
	   a property node with all occurring properties
	   substituted.
	- extra properties:settings->preferences->tree->
	          neighbour_gap: fill in number, vertical distance between
	           text.
	          link_colour: colour of lines in tree
		  link_pen:    linewidth of lines in tree
	- Printout did not function if no default printer was defined.
version 0.67 Wed Apr 16 16:55:30 CEST 2003
	- added display(View, sort_atoms_time_global)
	        display(View, sort_atoms_time) 
	  to leadsto, see usermanual.html
version 0.65 Mon Apr 14 19:08:26 CEST 2003
	- ttlchecker: Internally sometimes ground expressions were
	  not correctly detected to be ground. A.o. thisd lead to lots of
	  spurious warnings: "denotes argument sorts not checked"..
version 0.65 Tue Apr  8 13:33:16 CEST 2003
	- In ttlchecker no longer 0.0 == 0
	  Although printout sometimes outputs 0 instead of 0.0.
	- Unnecessary warning unchecked actual formal parameter removed.
version 0.64 Thu Apr  3 10:43:07 CEST 2003
	- If holds fact did not hold for whole trace, ttlchecker would crash
	- Sometimes NOT was ignored for not(holds(...))
version 0.63 Fri Mar 28 14:00:23 CET 2003
	- Bug in leadsto solved: if atoms had real arguments that
	  were near each other ( <1e-6 apart) leadsto crashed.
	- Changed coding of numbers: 0 is not identical to 0.0 now
	- There are still issues of rounding effects of numbers.
	- Improved error message if working directory has no write permission.
	- Rearranged some checker code : could introduce new bugs
version 0.62 Thu Mar 13 10:46:33 CET 2003
	- constants (constant(name,value)) in checker
	- constants in lteditor/ttleditor/ttlchecker
	- command line constants:  -constant name=value
	- testing for recursive constants
	- More tuning of logging in ttlchecker: 
	  command line -log X (as leadsto)
	- Test (and error) for expressions being numbers in
	  comparison formulae.
	- Internal: slightly improved code quality(node class hierarchy)
	  automatic test of Tbosse's spec in Makefile
version 0.61 Mon Mar 10 20:30:54 CET 2003
	- log checking verbose repaired
	- introduced advanced checking earlier version
	- option -log help and variants now supported for checker as well
version 0.60 Mon Mar 10 14:41:23 CET 2003
	- (Internal code rearrangement:logging)
	- solved one bug: could no longer reload lt specs
	- possibly solved bug iscmploc not seen?
version 0.59 Thu Mar  6 16:38:25 CET 200
	- Horrible bug : any not(Formula): not was effectively ignored.
	- range variables having constraints having non optimal 
	  instantiation ordering gave implementation error
version 0.58 Mon Mar  3 15:20:20 CET 2003
	- Solved: errors if formula contained instantiated numbers.
version 0.57 Fri Feb 28 17:27:32 CET 2003
	- Solved: \= operation in range now allowed (again) for
	  non-numeric sorts.
version 0.56 Fri Feb 28 14:50:22 CET 2003
	- Solved: multiple checking if first one had holds that never
	  held, following checks went wrong always (ouch)
version 0.55 (Fri Feb 28 14:23:06 CET 2003)
	- Bug solved: surious error messages:
	    ***ERROR:Cannot deal with variable m of kind "sortdef
version 0.54 
	- Solved bug:holds(State, aap(R:REAL - 1)) compiled incorrectly
	  and lead checking into trace mode.
version 0.53
	- previous versions were very unstable:
	- Each check operation reloaded all traces again without
	  removing old versions.
	- Lots of situations of uninstantiated/instantated terms
	  did not compile correctly
version 0.52
	- condition formulae probably did not work before this version
version 0.51
	- interval facts may have (backtracking) prolog sub goal, i.e.
	   interval([], X, Y, x) :-
	       between(1, 10, X),
	       Y is X + 0.1.
version 0.50
	- Solved bug variable copying went wrong
	- Solved bug of changing specification after Control-C
	- Changed checking algorithm (compiling to prolog)
	  * allow restricted infinite sort arguments
	- changed time handling.
version 0.49
	- Previous version did not default to optimized checking with
	  option cholds set.
version 0.48
	- Added feature : configurable setting of colours / defaults
	  with save settings options.
	- option cholds is enabled for check-quiet unless you explicitly 
	  disable it through option -nocholds or through the settings
	  GUI.
version 0.47
	- Solved one more (of the many) bugs when using REAL numbers.
version 0.46
	- Option cholds is more robust: You may check more than one
	  property without reloading now.
	- Solved one more (of the many) bugs when using REAL numbers.
version 0.45
	- Option -cholds works for more cases (but still estart tool
	  between tests)
	- Started implementing comparison operations in leadsto
version 0.44
	- Very much untested: option -cholds optimization may function.
	  Only check once when using -cholds and exit before checking
	  next specification: Otherwise garbage will be checked
	  for sure.
version 0.43
	- (Tried to add interrupt mechanism:Does not function yet)
version 0.42
	- Resize of mini-editors resizes text entry fields now
	- Reinserted some consistency checks in leadsto-reasoning-algorithm
	- Error message for using unimplemented comparison
	- More understandable error message for instantiating infinite sorts
	- Accepting more generic terms when reloading (notably [var]:[sort])
	- Error message for unimplemented comparison operations in leadsto
	- IMPORTANT:When loading a new trace after checking a property,
	  the TRACE sort definition did not update correctly.
	- IMPORTANT:contrary to handling variables in leadsto, in
	  the checker variables needed to be written as Var:Sort everywhere.
	  (Solved)
	- t:time + 1 no longer needs parentheses (in the GUI version!,
	  you still need to add (t:time) + 1 if you edit the .fm/.lt text
	  yourself.
version 0.41
	- First bug fixes for use of REAL time and REAL terms
	- builtin "time" sort: use TIME or time: changed time into TIME
	  in sugarscape1.fm
version 0.40
	- minor change in example .fm: removed TRACE sort from
	sugarscape1.fm (is automatically generated)
version 0.39
	- Lots of work on the ttlchecker.
version 0.38
	- Trivial: ttl checker window header now correctly says "ttl checker"
	  instead of "ttl editor"
version 0.37
	- ttlchecker: lots of work (almost functional)
	- ltbare/leadsto: saved trace was sometimes saved incorrectly
	- lteditor ttleditor: saved generic specification_element was
	  not recognised when reading back.
version 0.36
	- lteditor: restricted possible formulae according to 
	  requirements of leadsto/ltbare.
version 0.35
	- lteditor/ttleditor: changed enabling of node manipulation:
	  better enabling of change/insert operations
	- lteditor: recognise periodic(Vars, ST, ET, P, Formula) in input
version 0.34
	- lteditor/ttleditor/ttlchecker : saving generic node
	  [formula] => reload failed
	  More robust loading and saving of all generic entries.
	- ttleditor/lteditor: variables may contain conditions
version 0.33
	- leadsto/ltbare:
	  * Saved trace sometimes did not propagate cwa correctly: solved
	  * variables [x:between(1,10), y:between(1,10) < x] crashed: solved
version 0.32
	- lteditor:
	     *Copy of tree elements containing atoms crashed:solved
	     *Copy paste of other nodes did not update correctly:
	           range_nodes, var_nodes, sort nodes
	     * Wrong updating of A: C: (partly) fixed.
	- Command line option layout implementation improved
	- Improved ttlchecker
	- leadsto/ltbare: undefined sort lead to crashes
	  (Undefined procedure: algo:check_sort_value/3, spec:sort_element/2)
version 0.31
	- Could not change "or" into "and" etc. : solved
	- First test version of checker
version 0.30    jan 10 17:18
	- Added options for fine tuning what to show in trace.
	  Not supported in the graphical editor (yet).
	  See file examples/test/testdisplay.lt for example.
	- Added option for postscript printing:
	       -ps PsFile
version 0.29    jan 9 19:49
	- Saving cwa() went wrong : solved
	- added shortcuts for lt editor color
	- corrected formeditor.lnk, renamed ttleditor.lnk
version 0.28    jan 9 12:34

	  In leadsto this allows you to change what is logged 
	  (to the background window and to the file "log")
	- Worked out an example in the usermanual.
	- added updated example from EDJ:sugarscape1.lt
version 0.27    jan 8 18:41
	- Lots of internal changes for adaptation to ttleditor.
	  editors may be more buggy for some sub versions.
	- Bug solved: saving reloading cwa(_) did not function.
version 0.26    jan 8 13:22
	- Minimal configurability: option -gui 'color(node, light_blue)'
	  makes nodes colored (useful to see where right button has 
	  "node menu effect".
	- holds node copy->paste did not conserve STATE argument:solved
version 0.25 jan 7 22:43
	- Default range => leadsto crashed, solved
	- Could not cut generic [specification_element]
	- ERROR message wrong for [range] range
	- (Made example expfn.lt more clear by increasing step)
version 0.24 jan 7 2003
	- minor point:formula tags corrected.
	- Mayor point: system crashed everywhere where SWI-prolog
	  was not natively installed.
version 0.23
	- period did not become visible: solved
	- changed prefixes to distinguish nodes
	- double_click activates editor if defined.
version 0.22
	lteditor/formeditor
	- previous version introduced bug in loading formulae, solved
	- Added installation .bat files and shortcuts for 
	  installation on windows (c-drive)
version 0.21
	lteditor:
	- range editing went incorrect after save and reload:SOLVED
	- only set modified on if names really change
	formeditor:
	- replaced atom node by holds node
version 0.20
	lteditor:
	- Modified detection more complete.
version 0.19
	leadsto:
	- Interrupt run on windows (Quit button) functions ok now
version 0.18
	lteditor:
	- Probably previous version saving specs did not function
	- toplevel EDIT menu -> clear entry clears whole specification
	- standard allow only formula handled by leadsto.
	  Allow any formula with option -allform
	- not node may be collapsed
	leadsto:
	- load without run possible
	- default output less: no handle_term, no SET value
	- No longer restriction one spec loaded, may reload others
	- Removed lots of debugging checks from internals
version 0.17 (jan 02 16:50)
	- Ask for confirmation if saving from lteditor will overwrite
	  file with same name as loaded one if it was not generated
	  with lteditor.
version 0.16 (jan 02 16:30)
	- bug in windows version: crashed when editing a variable: solved
version 0.15 (jan 02 14:30)
	- Added extra tags to lteditor nodes
	- Support for reading in sort definitions as 
	   sort_element(S, X) :- member(X, [..])
	   (only for ground S and [..])
	- cwa(_) works, loading (edj's) orgdyn.lt saving reloading saving
	              and running in ltbare gives identical result.
version 0.14
	- Removed unit as predefined constant of efgh(1,1,1,1).
	  (Stopped working some verions ago)
	- Windows: printout in lteditor working
version 0.13
	- Added an experimental editor.
	- Accept a variant of leadsto and periodic entries:
	  intervals T1, T2 may be replaced by one argument range(T1, T2).
	  Could be useful for constants.
version 0.12
	- BUG solved: incorrectly did not accept atoms a(x, x+1)
	- BUG solved: lots of errors could have led to ignoring
	  rules instead of error messages.
	- Made variable substitution more stable: leadsto rules
	  intervals and periodic intervals use the same variable
	  handling. Global variables encompass every following entry in the
	  rule/interval spec.
	- Gave tooltips real functionality
version 0.11
	- Improved stability of handling specifications containing
	  cwa and rule variables.
	- Partly solved the problem of not allowing real prolog code
	  in specifications.
	  You may use member/2 in your ".lt" specifications, but
	  nothing else (unless at VU solaris)
	  Later on we may add the whole SWI-prolog system to allow
	  the specification to use any built-in predicate.
version 0.10
	- BUG solved windows:ltbare out of local stack before showresult
	- BUG solved: installation not ok, missing library toolbar
	- BUG solved: crashes after trace -> sim
	- BUG solved: -showtrace option in ltbare did not filter correct
	               file extensions
version 0.9
	- Added gui functionality to leadsto. The bare commandline
	  option driven version will remain available as ltbare.
	- Changed trace extension to ".tr".
	- Changed leadsto specification extension to ".lt"
	- Bug solved: error if constant used in interval ranges.
	- Bug solved: if display_number_range specified, but only
	       one value was available, leadsto crashed
	- Bug solved: if display_number_range contained > 1 interval
	  entry, leadsto used to crash.
version 0.8
	- A bug in algorithm antecedent failure cleanup, only occurred
	  when rules contained variables.
version 0.7
	- lots of options w.r.t. creating logs and showing results
	  ( do leadsto -h for more info)
version 0.6
	- allow sortdef(SortName, GroundListOfElements) in specification.
	- somewhat friendlier error messages.
version 0.5
	- Probably solved a bug: if one interval encompassed
	  whole start_time -> end_time range, leadsto could
	  crash.
version 0.4
	- Solved various algorithm/simulation bugs
	- added option for displaying a saved trace:
	   each run generates a trace.pl.
	   $ leadsto -displaytrace trace.pl
	   shows the trace.
	- Solved some bugs in displaytrace already:
	   - some values were not displayed
	   - trace ranges were not saved, used default end_time(3000)
version 0.3
	- postscript printout: right click on picture.
	  Output to printer will only work on solaris.
version 0.2
	- Minute bugs in option -logging help
version 0.1
	- Introduced logging options -nolog, -log argument for finetuning
	  logging
	- Checking EFGH for valid delay: all numbers, all >= 0 not sum = 0
	  If H = 0 then G = 0
	- Trying to maintain ChangeLog and version numbers
