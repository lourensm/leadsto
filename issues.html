<h2>Shortest term</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Using holds(State, Atom, TF) confuses me so much that I get a
slightly uncomfortable feeling when seeing the |= variant.
I should replace it.
<LI>Copy paste low level software philosophy very gammel.
</UL>

<H2>To Do/Bugs Short term</H2>
<UL>
<LI><h3>ToDo List</h3>
<uL>
<li>Single quotes in output is rather stupid.
<li>Leadsto trace visualisation: make single atoms right clickable=>
<ul>
<li>Inspect single atom trace : show atom name in window header, make range
change with size
<li>Allow display of subrange?
<li>Printout?
<li>Add atom to view set?
<li>Edit current view
</ul>
<li>Leadsto interactive options: same as ttlchecker: make all settings editable:
<ul>
<li>font
<li>tracerangepixels
<li>allow colour changes
</ul>
<li>leadsto: save display options optionally with lt spec.
<li>leadsto: redesign algorithm: make GC more robust. Try to increase step size.
<li>BUG: efgh = 0001 leads to crash
<li>background knowledge
<li>recursive properties
<li>Add information types to leadsto and checker
<li>Integrate leadsto editor and leadsto checker
<li>Cannot change atoms to property_applications to ...
</ul>
<LI><h3>Automate simple ordering of holds formulae</h3>


Explore <code>such(X:s1< a, .. , , f(X,Y,Z), formula)</code> and then 
<code>size(such((X,Y,Z), formula)</code>
and whole range of set operations... a cesspool ...
<p>
Then, analyse: forall -> exists, within each qvar environment,
rewrite formula as disjunction of conjunctions. Then find positive binding 
occurrences of quantifier variables. Result per conjunction: no_occurrence,
binding, needs_bound.
<p>
Partition the set into those that have no_occurrence, binding, needs_bound.
But different variables require different partitions.
As soon as one conjunction has needs_bound, rest not very important.
As soon as all conjunctions have same binding for variable, the
variable is no longer relevant for partitioning.
In the end we simply could partition each conjunction into its own
partition.
Need an operation that for a subformula that is not a disjunction
and given a set of qvars returns the set of var bindings. Difference with
previous approach: allow reordering of conjunctions. But very tricky,
may need deep splitup of disjunctions.
<p>
and(exists(or(F1,F2)) +> no, should be seen as a disjunction, unless
F1, F2 both have identical qvar bindings. So splitting up into
disjunction of conjunctions already depends on qvars.
and(not(exists(and(F1,F2))), F3) => ? ok?
 and(not(exists(or(F1,F2))), F3) ->
 and(not(or(exists(F1),exists(F2)))) (if different bindings) ->
 and(and(exists(F1),exists(F2))) so not(exists) handling independent
 of substructure, could say: any occurring qvar must be needs_bound.
<p>
But seems counterintuitive.
not(exists(something_containingqvar(X)))
not(exists(Y, holds(aap(X,Y)))) => would not bind X! but could still be
simplified as check, new kind of binding: not(exists(X)) but
only for holds? not(exists(X < 3)) could be ok as well.
So: binding, needs_bound, not_exists_binding(i.e. all?), 
<p>
NEXT:
<ol>
<li>Replace forall by not exists, and for the time normalise by taking out any 
  disjunctions.
<li>If a variable occcurs positive as a holds at some depth, it may be
  bound.
<li>If a variable occurs negative in a holds fact at some depth, check whether
  we are dealing with an infinite sort. In that case we know that there must be
  some value of the variable where all such negative holds facts do not
  hold ... tricky..
<li>If a variable does not occur in a holds, but in some other non = 
  call, then we must start instantiating.
<li>If there is a positive holds at some depth, coding might proceed as
  follows. Do we depend on that holds fact (enclosed in not(not(..exists)))
  being true? Then, if we encounter a \+ in between the quantifier
  position and the holds, we add a holds(...x..) term outside the first
  \+.
<li>Even if we are allowed to not preinstantiate, i.e. if x occurs
  effectively pos in a holdsfact then we should not iterate over x unless
  |x| < |holds(f(x))|
<li>Normalised would be F if
<pre>
F == and(F1,..Fn) Fi normalised
or
F == exists(X, F(X)) F(X) normalised
or 
F == not exists(X, F(X)) F(X) normalised
or
F == holds or not(holds) or cmpop (propbably should precompile =
</pre>
<pre>
- X occurs posholds in F if F == holds(fact) and X occurs in fact
- X occurs negholds in F if F == not(holds(fact)) and X occurs in fact
- X occurs posholds in F if F == and(F1,..Fn) and X occurs posholds in some Fi
- X occurs negholds in F if F == and(F1,..Fn) and X occurs negholds in some Fi
  (not posholds and not otherwise)
- X occurs posholds in F if F == exists(X,F(X)) and X occurs posholds in F(X)
- X occurs negholds in F if F == exists(X,F(X)) and X occurs negholds in F(X)
- X occurs posholds in F if F == not(exists(X,F(X))) and X occurs 
             negholds in F(X)
- X occurs negholds in F if F == not(exists(X,F(X))) and X occurs 
             posholds in F(X)
exists(X, not(exists(Y, not(exists(Z,holds(a(x,y,z)))))))
<=>
exists(X, forall(Y, exists(Z, holds(a(x,y,z)))))
</pre>
That is either Y empty or 
forall(Y, F(Y)) implies emptyrange(Y) or exists(Y, F(Y))
So, any entry not(exists(Z, G)) implies emptyrange(Z) or exists(Z, not(G))
Seems to lead to the proof, but we need to be carefull about the
emptyrange check.
<p>
So we have some formula where X occurs posholds in some holds(f(X))
then 
If F is and(...., exists(X, and(...,not(exists(Y, Fp)))))
F implies notemptyrange(X) and (emptyrange(Y(X) or exists(Y, not(Fp)))) 
this would leave X bound to some holds(f(X))
<p>
Now it could be that some X would be negholds in a not(holds(aap(X,Y))).
Almost any way this proves to be a problem.
<p>
We should probably not remove disjunctions, but analyse and sort variable
occurrences in all parts of the disjunction and maintain the worst
case binding for each variable.

Here we could distinguish 1-1 relationships from n-m ones.
For the time being we could also pre-instantiate such dependencies.
